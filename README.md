# Data-Visualization-Group
Project on visualizing covid 19 data to multiple types of graph which is crawled from worldmeter website.

Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

How to run:

Because the data is stopped crawling on 11/3/2022, you don't need to run crawl_data.ipynb. If you insist, backup Corona_by_day.csv first to avoid any errors.

When running crawl_data.ipynb, you may encounter some errors which are redundant of spaces while crawling data, try running it until every cell runs successfully.

Then, run visualize_data.ipynb to see the whole project about visualizing Covid19 data. The report and jupyter markdown is written in Vietnamese as this is a school assignment worked in group, sorry...
